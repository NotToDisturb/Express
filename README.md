# Express

Delivering packages in the Verse can become a lengthy task when working on multiple contracts at the same time. Employees may find themselves asking questions such as:

> Where should I go first?

> How do I minimize the number of times I visit a location?

> I have to travel to another planet? AGAIN!?

Express aims to answer these questions efficiently by providing the employee with a tool that centralizes all their active deliveries and calculates the most optimal delivery route. This significantly reduces the time spent by an employee making decisions and enhancing the experience of everyone involved:
- The client sees their wait time reduced
- The employee earns money faster
- The employer observes an increase in consumer trust

## How to use

We are glad you want to give Express a shot! You have two main choices to set it up:

- Download the [latest release](https://github.com/NotToDisturb/Express/releases) on your mobiGlass (Windows PC) if you want a fully tested Express experience
- Set up a [developer environment](DEVELOPMENT.md#express-development) in you want to experiment with the latest, bleeding edge features

Now that you are all set up, let's get some deliveries going. Here's what you'll want to do, step by step:

1. Ensure you are in a dark area with no bright objects around.
1. Launch Express. You will see two options:
    1. `Take screenshots`
    1. `Images on a folder`
1. For this guide we will select option 1. You will again see two options:
    1. `ENTER to screenshot`
    1. `SPACE to continue`
1. Before pressing either button, head to the `Contract Manager` application.
1. Under the `General` tab, press the `Delivery` button.
1. Select one of the available missions.
    1. Be mindful that, for now, Express only works for missions that clearly state the pickup and dropoff location for each package individually.
1. Before pressing `Accept Offer`, head back to Express and press `ENTER`
1. Head back to the `Contract Manager` app and accept the contract.
1. You may repeat steps 3-8 as many times as you wish.
1. Once all the desired contracts have been processed by Express and accepted, press `SPACE`. You will now see four options:
    1. `Deliveries per location`
    1. `Deliveries per package`
    1. `Optimal path`
    1. `Exit`
1. For this guide we will select option 3. This will print the optimal route for the processed contracts, save it!
1. You will again see the four options. This time select 4.
1. Follow the route to minimize wasted time, and be sure to recommend Express to a fellow employee!
